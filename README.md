# stocknews
Developed a program that sends me updates regarding a particular stock. Whenever there is a 5% or greater change with the price of the stock I get a text with the price of the
change and relevant news regarding the company. Utilized Alpha Vantage API for the stock price, NewsAPI for relevant news and Twilio API for receiving text messages
for this project.

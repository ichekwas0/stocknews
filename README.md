# stocknews
Developed a program that sends me updates regarding a particular stock. Whenever there is a 5% or greater change with the price of the stock between the previous day and the day before that I get a text with the price that stock price increased or decreased by and relevant news regarding the company to help me make decisions regarding buying, selling, or holding the stock. Utilized Alpha Vantage API for the stock price, NewsAPI for relevant news and Twilio API for receiving text messages
for this project. My authentication(apikey, auth_token, account_sid) was done with free accounts so it does not matter if people try to access it.
